;; These tests don't seem to work with `defined` values when they have been pulled in with
;; a require statement, but work fine if they are pasted into the test file. Not sure why yet.

;; check-expect: Any Any -> None
;; (check-expect expression expected-value)
;; Purpose: check-expect checks if expression evaluates to expected-value.
;; If it does, print "Test passed.", otherwise print a helpful error message.

;; Example: (check-expect (+ 10 2) 12) prints "Test passed."
;;          (check-expect (+ 10 3) 12) prints "Test failed: (+ 10 3) => 13   --- Expected: 12"

;; (check-within expression expected-value tolerance)
;; Purpose: check-within checks if expression evaluates to a value that lies within tolerance
;; of expected-value. If it does, print "Test passed.", otherwise print a helpful error message.

;; Example: (check-within (sqrt 2) 1.4 0.1) prints "Test passed."
;;          (check-within (sqrt 2) 1.4 0.001) prints "Test failed: (sqrt 2) => 1.4121... --- Expected to be within 0.001 of 1.4"
